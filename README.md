## Sonarqube, Docker and .Net Core

This repo demonstrates how to configure sonarqube and postgres in docker. It also shows how to write a multi-stage Dockerfile for .net core app that can publish code coverage stats to sonarqube.


### Prerequisites
The demo application uses nunit for unit testing and [coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) for code coverage data.
